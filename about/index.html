      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p>
        I used to play Basketball and Football in JV team at High School.
        Beside school, I usually go to play soccer with friends on the
        weekend. During the week, I like going to the gym. Moreover, music
        has played an important role in my life. It's help me go through
        depression.
